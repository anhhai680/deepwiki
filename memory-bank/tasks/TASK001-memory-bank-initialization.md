Initialize a comprehensive memory bank structure for the DeepWiki project to establish proper project documentation, pattern recognition, and task management systems. This memory bank will serve as the foundation for all future development work and ensure consistent project context across development sessions.

## Original Request
> "Initialize memory bank for this project"

## Thought Process

### Initial Analysis
Upon receiving the request to initialize a memory bank, I analyzed the DeepWiki project to understand:
1. **Project Scope**: AI-powered documentation generator for code repositories
2. **Technology Stack**: Next.js + FastAPI full-stack application
3. **Current State**: Well-developed core features, needs production readiness
4. **Architecture**: Multi-provider AI integration with RAG capabilities

### Key Discoveries

- **Real-Time Features**: WebSocket streaming and live updates
- **Multi-Language Support**: Internationalization with 10+ languages
- **Production Ready**: Docker support and comprehensive configuration
- **Technical Debt**: Limited testing, basic error handling, security needs

### Approach Decision
Based on the project analysis, I decided to create a comprehensive memory bank that:
1. **Documents Current State**: Captures existing architecture and patterns
2. **Identifies Patterns**: Recognizes recurring design decisions
3. **Tracks Progress**: Monitors feature completion and technical debt
4. **Establishes Workflow**: Creates task management and progress tracking
