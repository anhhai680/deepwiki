# [TASK011] - Phase 5.1: Models (From api.py)

**Status:** âœ… Completed (100%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Completed:** 2025-08-28  
**Due Date:** Week 5 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** API Layer Refactoring (Week 5)

## Original Request
Extract Pydantic models from api.py and organize them by domain (chat, wiki, rag, common) while preserving existing validation.

## Thought Process
The api.py file (634 lines) contains multiple Pydantic models mixed with endpoint definitions and application configuration. This task focuses on extracting all the model definitions and organizing them into domain-specific modules for better maintainability.

The extraction must preserve all existing validation rules and ensure that the models continue to work with the API endpoints without any changes to the API contract.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract all Pydantic models from api.py
- Organize models by domain area
- Preserve all existing validation rules
- Maintain API contract compatibility

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 5.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for model extraction and organization
- Ready for implementation to begin

### 2025-08-28
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully extracted all Pydantic models from api.py
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Organized models into domain-specific modules:
  - `api/models/wiki.py` - Wiki-related models (WikiPage, WikiSection, WikiStructureModel, WikiCacheData, WikiCacheRequest, WikiExportRequest)
  - `api/models/common.py` - Common models (ProcessedProjectEntry, RepoInfo)
  - `api/models/config.py` - Configuration models (Model, Provider, ModelConfig, AuthorizationConfig)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Preserved all existing validation rules and field definitions
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Updated import statements in api.py to use new model locations
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Verified all models compile without syntax errors
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Confirmed API functionality remains intact
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: All existing tests continue to pass
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Created comprehensive models package with proper imports

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available

## Success Criteria
- [x] All Pydantic models extracted from api.py
- [x] Models organized by domain logically
- [x] All existing validation rules preserved
- [x] Import statements updated correctly
- [x] API contract remains unchanged
- [x] Model functionality fully tested

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: Model extraction is typically straightforward
- **Potential Issue**: Complex model inheritance could be broken
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing of model relationships and validation
