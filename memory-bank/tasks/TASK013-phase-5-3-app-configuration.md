# [TASK013] - Phase 5.3: App Configuration

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 5 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** API Layer Refactoring (Week 5)

## Original Request
Create app.py for FastAPI configuration (extracted from api.py) while preserving middleware and CORS settings.

## Thought Process
After extracting models and endpoints from api.py, the remaining FastAPI application configuration needs to be organized into a dedicated app.py file. This includes middleware setup, CORS configuration, and other application-level settings.

This task ensures that the FastAPI application configuration is properly organized while maintaining all existing functionality and settings.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract FastAPI configuration from api.py
- Preserve all middleware and CORS settings
- Organize application setup in dedicated file
- Maintain application functionality

## Progress Tracking

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 5.3 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for app configuration extraction
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK012: Endpoints should be extracted and available
- TASK011: Models should be extracted and available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] FastAPI configuration extracted to app.py
- [ ] All middleware and CORS settings preserved
- [ ] Application routing configured properly
- [ ] main.py updated to use new structure
- [ ] Application starts and functions correctly
- [ ] All configuration settings maintained

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Application configuration errors could prevent startup
- **Mitigation**: Careful extraction and testing of configuration
- **Potential Issue**: Middleware or CORS settings could be lost
- **Mitigation**: Detailed verification of all application settings
