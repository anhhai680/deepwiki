# [TASK021] - Phase 8.3: Final Integration

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Completed (100%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 8 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Testing and Migration (Week 8)

## Original Request
Update main.py to use new structure, remove old files after validation, and perform final testing and validation.

## Thought Process
This is the final step in the restructuring process where we integrate all the extracted components, update the application entry point, and remove the old files. This must be done carefully with comprehensive validation to ensure nothing is broken.

This task represents the completion of the restructuring effort and the transition to the new architecture.

## Implementation Plan
- Update main.py to use the new component structure
- Validate that all functionality works with new structure
- Remove old files after thorough validation
- Perform comprehensive final testing

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%
