# [TASK028] - Implement Multi-Repository Selection from Left Sidebar

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** September 5, 2025  
**Updated:** September 6, 2025

## Updated Request (September 6, 2025)
Instead of fixing the repository selection dropdown, implement a new approach where users can select multiple repositories directly from the left sidebar menu. When multi-repository mode is enabled, the selected repositories from the sidebar should automatically appear as the chosen repositories.

## New Approach
1. **Left Sidebar Multi-Selection**: Allow users to select multiple repositories from the ExistingProjectsPanel (left sidebar)
2. **Automatic Integration**: When multi-repository mode is enabled, automatically use the selected repositories from the sidebar
3. **Visual Feedback**: Show which repositories are selected in the sidebar with appropriate styling
4. **Seamless UX**: Remove the need for the dropdown selector and provide a more intuitive selection experience

## Previous Problem Analysis (Dropdown Approach - DEPRECATED)
Based on the screenshot and code analysis, when multi-repository mode is enabled on the home page, the MultiRepositorySelector component is not displaying the dropdown list of available repositories. However, we are now changing the approach to use sidebar selection instead.

## Root Cause of UX Issue
The dropdown approach creates unnecessary complexity and friction. Users should be able to:
1. See all available repositories in the sidebar
2. Select multiple repositories with checkboxes or similar UI
3. Have those selections automatically flow into multi-repository mode
4. Remove the need for a separate dropdown interface

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Update ExistingProjectsPanel for Multi-Selection (60 minutes)
1. **Add Multi-Selection State Management**
   - Add props for `selectedRepositories` array and `onRepositoriesChange` callback
   - Add state for multi-selection mode toggle
   - Update component interface to support both single and multi-selection modes

2. **Implement Multi-Selection UI**
   - Add checkboxes or selection indicators for each repository item
   - Add "Select All" / "Clear All" functionality
   - Show count of selected repositories
   - Add visual styling to distinguish selected repositories

3. **Update Event Handlers**
   - Modify click handlers to support both single selection (existing) and multi-selection
   - Add toggle functionality for multi-selection mode
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing single-selection behavior

### Phase 2: Update Main Page Integration (30 minutes)
4. **Connect Sidebar to Multi-Repository Mode**
   - Pass selected repositories from sidebar to Ask component
   - Update state management in main page to handle multi-selection
   - Ensure seamless flow between sidebar selection and multi-repository mode

5. **Update ChatPanel Integration**
   - Modify ChatPanel to handle multiple repositories
   - Update repository display in chat header for multi-repository mode
   - Ensure proper repoInfo handling for multiple repositories

### Phase 3: Enhance Multi-Repository Experience (45 minutes)
6. **Improve MultiRepositorySelector Integration**
   - Keep existing manual input functionality as fallback
   - Show selected repositories from sidebar in the multi-repository component
   - Allow users to add additional repositories manually if needed
   - Add clear indication when repositories are auto-selected from sidebar

7. **Add Toggle Controls**
   - Add multi-selection toggle in sidebar header
   - Provide clear visual feedback for current selection mode
   - Add tooltips and help text for new functionality

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish (30 minutes)
8. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Test single repository selection (existing functionality)
   - Test multi-repository selection from sidebar
   - Test integration with Ask component and multi-repository mode
   - Verify backward compatibility and error handling

9. **UX Improvements**
   - Add loading states and transitions
   - Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen readers)
   - Add proper ARIA labels and semantic markup
   - Polish visual design and interactions

## Expected Outcome
- Users can select multiple repositories directly from the left sidebar using checkboxes
- Multi-repository mode automatically uses selected repositories from sidebar
- Seamless integration between sidebar selection and Ask component
- Clear visual feedback showing which repositories are selected
- Backward compatibility with existing single repository selection
- Improved UX by removing the need for dropdown repository selection

## Files to Modify
- `src/components/ExistingProjectsPanel.tsx` - Add multi-selection functionality
- `src/types/home-page-ask.ts` - Update interfaces for multi-selection
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Update state management and integration
- `src/components/ChatPanel.tsx` - Handle multiple repository display
- `src/components/Ask.tsx` - Integration with sidebar-selected repositories (minor changes)

## Progress Log

- Updated task approach based on user feedback
- Changed from fixing dropdown to implementing sidebar multi-selection
- Developed new implementation plan focused on sidebar integration
- Started analysis of current components and interfaces
- Task status changed to In Progress with new direction

**Phase 1 Complete:**
- Updated type definitions in `src/types/home-page-ask.ts` for multi-repository support
- Enhanced ExistingProjectsPanel with multi-selection functionality:
  - Added checkbox UI for each repository item
  - Implemented multi-selection mode toggle in header
  - Added "Select All" / "Clear All" functionality
  - Updated click handlers to support both single and multi-selection modes
- Successfully integrated with existing single-selection behavior

**Phase 2 Complete:**

  - Added multi-repository state variables
  - Created handlers for repository changes and mode toggling
  - Updated ExistingProjectsPanel props to include new functionality
- Enhanced ChatPanel to support multi-repository mode:
  - Updated component interface and props
  - Added conditional display for single vs multi-repository mode
  - Proper handling of repository info arrays
- All TypeScript compilation and linting passed successfully

**Next Steps:**

- Integrate with Ask component's multi-repository mode
- Update MultiRepositorySelector to show pre-selected repositories
- Polish user experience and add accessibility improvements

**UI Enhancement (September 6, 2025):**
- Removed redundant "Selected Repositories" display from Ask form
- Added `showSelectedRepositories` prop to MultiRepositorySelector component
- Set `showSelectedRepositories={false}` in Ask component to hide redundant display
- **Hidden dropdown when repositories already selected from sidebar** - prevents UI clutter
- Clean UI that only shows selections in left sidebar, saving space and reducing redundancy
- Maintained manual input functionality through search dropdown (only shown when no repos selected)
- Smart conditional rendering: dropdown only appears when no repositories are selected from sidebar

**Final Result:**
- ✅ **Perfect UX**: Dropdown only shows when needed (no repositories selected)
- ✅ **Clean Interface**: No redundant UI elements when repositories are selected
- ✅ **Space Efficient**: Maximum space savings in the Ask form area
- ✅ **Intuitive Flow**: Users naturally select from sidebar first, dropdown as fallback
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Manual input still available when no sidebar selections made
