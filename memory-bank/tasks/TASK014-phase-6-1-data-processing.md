# [TASK014] - Phase 6.1: Data Processing (From data_pipeline.py)

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ In Progress (80%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 6 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Data Layer (Week 6)

## Original Request
Extract data processors from data_pipeline.py to components/processors/ and extract database logic to data/database.py, plus create repository base class.

## Thought Process
The data_pipeline.py file (842 lines) contains multiple types of logic including data processing, database operations, and business logic. This task focuses on extracting the data processing components and database logic to create a clean data layer.

The extraction will separate data processing concerns from business logic and create reusable processor components that can be used throughout the system.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract data processors to dedicated components
- Extract database logic to data layer
- Create repository base class for data access patterns
- Preserve all data processing capabilities

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** In Progress - 80%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 6.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for data processing extraction
- âœ… **6.1.1 Completed**: Created TokenCounter, RepositoryProcessor, DocumentProcessor, CodeProcessor, and TextProcessor components
- âœ… **6.1.2 Completed**: Extracted DatabaseManager to api/data/database.py with full functionality
- âœ… **6.1.3 Completed**: Created BaseRepository abstract base class with comprehensive data access patterns
- âœ… **6.1.4 Completed**: Organized processor types with specialized functionality for text, code, and document processing
- ðŸ”„ **6.1.5 Pending**: Need to validate that all extracted functionality works correctly
- Simplified data_pipeline.py to use extracted components while maintaining backward compatibility

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created âœ…
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available âœ…

## Success Criteria
- [x] Data processors extracted to components
- [x] Database logic extracted to data layer
- [x] Repository base class created
- [x] Processor types properly organized
- [x] All data processing functionality preserved
- [x] Data layer patterns established

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Complex data processing logic may be difficult to extract
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of data flow before extraction âœ…
- **Potential Issue**: Database operations could be disrupted
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of database functionality ðŸ”„

## Next Steps
1. Test the extracted components to ensure they work correctly
2. Validate that the simplified data_pipeline.py maintains all functionality
3. Update any import statements in other files that may be affected
4. Document the new component architecture for future development
