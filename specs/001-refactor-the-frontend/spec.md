# Feature Specification: Frontend Code Refactoring for Maintainability

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-the-frontend`  
**Created**: September 9, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "refactor the frontend code at src/ to make it cleaner and easy maintainability. Especially reduce the LOC in each file, currently there are a lot of file too long and it's so hard to understand or improve anything."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature clear: Refactor existing frontend codebase for better maintainability
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: Developers maintaining the codebase
   → Actions: Refactor, split files, modularize components
   → Data: Existing React/TypeScript components and utilities
   → Constraints: Maintain existing functionality, no breaking changes
3. No unclear aspects identified - requirements are straightforward
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Developer workflows for code maintenance and feature development
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement focused on code organization and maintainability
6. No new data entities - working with existing code structure
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements are testable through code metrics and developer experience
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT developers need for better maintainability and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no specific refactoring techniques, file structures)
- 👥 Written for development team leads and project stakeholders

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the DeepWiki frontend, I need the codebase to be well-organized and maintainable so that I can quickly understand, debug, and extend features without getting overwhelmed by large, complex files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to fix a bug in the repository page (currently 2,357 lines), **When** they navigate to the relevant file, **Then** they can understand the component's purpose and logic within 2-3 minutes instead of getting lost in thousands of lines
2. **Given** a developer wants to modify the Ask component (currently 1,062 lines), **When** they open the component file, **Then** the file is small enough (under 300 lines) to comprehend quickly
3. **Given** a developer needs to update the Mermaid diagram rendering (currently 624 lines), **When** they access the component, **Then** they can locate specific functionality without scrolling through extensive theme configurations
4. **Given** a new developer joins the project, **When** they explore the frontend codebase, **Then** they can identify the purpose and structure of each module within 30 minutes instead of being overwhelmed by massive files
5. **Given** a developer needs to reuse component logic, **When** they search the codebase, **Then** they can easily find and import reusable utilities and hooks instead of copying code from large components
6. **Given** a developer runs code analysis tools, **When** they check file complexity metrics, **Then** no single file exceeds 500 lines (currently 7 critical files exceed this threshold)
7. **Given** a developer needs to modify the home page (currently 707 lines), **When** they make changes, **Then** they can work on isolated concerns without affecting unrelated functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when refactoring breaks existing component interfaces?
- How does the system handle circular dependencies that might emerge during modularization?
- How are deeply nested component hierarchies simplified without losing functionality?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST maintain all existing functionality after refactoring without any behavioral changes
- **FR-002**: System MUST reduce critical oversized files so that no single component file exceeds 500 lines of code (currently 7 files exceed this threshold)
- **FR-003**: System MUST prioritize refactoring of critical oversized files (2,357, 1,299, 1,062, 707, 625, 624, 533 line files)
- **FR-004**: System MUST eliminate code duplication by extracting shared logic into reusable utilities and hooks
- **FR-005**: System MUST organize related functionality into logical modules and directories  
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain consistent TypeScript interfaces and type definitions across all components
- **FR-007**: System MUST preserve all existing component props and API contracts to ensure no breaking changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST improve code readability by separating concerns (UI, business logic, data fetching, state management)
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure all refactored components pass existing tests and maintain test coverage
- **FR-010**: System MUST establish clear separation between presentation components and container components
- **FR-011**: System MUST extract complex inline styles and large data structures into separate files or constants (especially Mermaid theme configurations)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Critical Oversized Files**: Files requiring immediate refactoring due to excessive size (>500 lines)
  - `app/[owner]/[repo]/page.tsx` (2,357 lines) - Main repository page component
  - `app/[owner]/[repo]/slides/page.tsx` (1,299 lines) - Slides presentation component  
  - `components/Ask.tsx` (1,062 lines) - Chat/Q&A interface component
  - `app/page.tsx` (707 lines) - Home page component
  - `app/[owner]/[repo]/workshop/page.tsx` (625 lines) - Workshop page component
  - `components/Mermaid.tsx` (624 lines) - Diagram rendering component
  - `components/UserSelector.tsx` (533 lines) - User/model selection component
- **Utility Modules**: Shared functions and helpers that can be extracted from oversized components
- **Type Definitions**: TypeScript interfaces that can be consolidated and reused (currently scattered across large files)
- **Custom Hooks**: Stateful logic that can be extracted from oversized components for reusability
- **Constants**: Configuration data, styles, and static content that can be externalized (especially from Mermaid.tsx theme configurations)
