# [TASK009] - Phase 4.1: Chat Service (From simple_chat.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 4 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Service Layer (Week 4)

## Original Request
Extract business logic from simple_chat.py to create a dedicated chat service while preserving chat orchestration and state management.

## Thought Process
After extracting the chat pipeline, we need to extract the business logic and orchestration components that manage chat operations at a higher level. This includes session management, chat coordination, and business rules that govern chat behavior.

The service layer will provide a clean interface for chat operations while utilizing the chat pipeline for actual processing.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract business logic from simple_chat.py
- Create chat service for orchestration
- Preserve chat state management capabilities
- Implement service layer patterns

| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 4.1.1 | Extract business logic to `services/chat_service.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | High-level chat management |
| 4.1.2 | Preserve chat orchestration and state management | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Session and state handling |
| 4.1.3 | Implement service layer patterns | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Consistent service architecture |
| 4.1.4 | Integrate with chat pipeline | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Use pipeline for processing |
| 4.1.5 | Test chat service functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate service operations |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 4.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for chat service extraction and implementation
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK008: Chat pipeline should be implemented
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Business logic extracted to service layer
- [ ] Chat orchestration preserved
- [ ] State management functionality maintained
- [ ] Service layer patterns implemented consistently
- [ ] Integration with chat pipeline working
- [ ] All chat service functionality preserved

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Separating service logic from pipeline may introduce complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear interface definition between service and pipeline
- **Potential Issue**: State management could be disrupted
- **Mitigation**: Careful extraction of state-related code
