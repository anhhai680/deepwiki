# [TASK004] - Phase 2.1: Generator Components (From Client Files)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 2 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Component Extraction (Week 2)

## Original Request
Extract generator components from various client files and organize them under a unified interface structure.

## Thought Process
This task involves extracting AI provider-specific logic from multiple large client files and organizing them into a cohesive generator component system. Each provider (OpenAI, Azure, Bedrock, DashScope, OpenRouter, Ollama) currently has its own client file with significant code duplication and inconsistent interfaces.

The goal is to create a unified generator interface while preserving all provider-specific functionality. This will make it easier to add new providers, maintain existing ones, and ensure consistent behavior across all AI providers.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract logic from each client file to dedicated provider modules
- Create unified base interface for all generators
- Implement generator manager for orchestration
- Ensure all provider-specific features are preserved

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 2.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for each provider extraction and interface creation
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be in place

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All provider logic extracted to dedicated modules
- [ ] Unified generator interface implemented
- [ ] Generator manager provides consistent provider access
- [ ] All provider-specific features preserved
- [ ] No functionality lost during extraction
- [ ] Consistent error handling across all providers

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Large client files with complex logic may be difficult to extract
- **Mitigation**: Incremental extraction with testing at each step
- **Potential Issue**: Provider-specific features may be lost
- **Mitigation**: Careful code review and comprehensive testing
