# [TASK008] - Phase 3.2: Chat Pipeline (From simple_chat.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 3 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Pipeline Implementation (Week 3)

## Original Request
Extract chat logic from simple_chat.py and implement it as a proper pipeline while preserving conversation flow and streaming support.

## Thought Process
The simple_chat.py file (690 lines) contains complex chat functionality including conversation flow management, streaming support, and state management. This needs to be carefully extracted into a pipeline structure while preserving all existing functionality.

The chat pipeline is user-facing and critical to the application experience, so any changes must maintain existing behavior while improving organization and maintainability.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract chat orchestration logic to dedicated pipeline
- Preserve existing conversation flow and state management
- Maintain streaming support capabilities
- Ensure seamless user experience

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 3.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for chat pipeline extraction with focus on preserving functionality
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK007: Base pipeline framework should be available
- TASK004: Generator components should be available
- TASK006: Memory components should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Chat logic extracted to pipeline structure
- [ ] Conversation flow preserved exactly
- [ ] Streaming support maintained
- [ ] Integration with base pipeline framework
- [ ] All existing chat functionality preserved
- [ ] User experience unchanged

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Complex chat logic with streaming may be difficult to extract
- **Mitigation**: Incremental extraction with extensive testing
- **Potential Issue**: Streaming functionality could be broken
- **Mitigation**: Maintain streaming interfaces and test thoroughly
