# [TASK011] - Phase 5.1: Models (From api.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 5 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** API Layer Refactoring (Week 5)

## Original Request
Extract Pydantic models from api.py and organize them by domain (chat, wiki, rag, common) while preserving existing validation.

## Thought Process
The api.py file (634 lines) contains multiple Pydantic models mixed with endpoint definitions and application configuration. This task focuses on extracting all the model definitions and organizing them into domain-specific modules for better maintainability.

The extraction must preserve all existing validation rules and ensure that the models continue to work with the API endpoints without any changes to the API contract.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract all Pydantic models from api.py
- Organize models by domain area
- Preserve all existing validation rules
- Maintain API contract compatibility

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 5.1.1 | Extract Pydantic models to `models/` directory | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Base model extraction |
| 5.1.2 | Organize by domain (chat, wiki, rag, common) | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Domain-specific organization |
| 5.1.3 | Preserve existing validation | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Maintain validation rules |
| 5.1.4 | Update import statements in api files | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Fix model imports |
| 5.1.5 | Test model functionality and validation | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate extracted models |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 5.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for model extraction and organization
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All Pydantic models extracted from api.py
- [ ] Models organized by domain logically
- [ ] All existing validation rules preserved
- [ ] Import statements updated correctly
- [ ] API contract remains unchanged
- [ ] Model functionality fully tested

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: Model extraction is typically straightforward
- **Potential Issue**: Complex model inheritance could be broken
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing of model relationships and validation
