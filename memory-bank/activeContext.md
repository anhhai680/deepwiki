### **Wiki Refresh Functionality Fix (January 15, 2025)** - **COMPLETED**

#### **Critical Bug Resolution**
**Problem**: Wiki refresh button failing with error "No valid XML found in response"
**Root Cause**: Frontend sending simplified prompt "Determine wiki structure based on repository analysis" instead of detailed XML format instructions
**Impact**: Users unable to refresh wikis, breaking core functionality

#### **Technical Implementation**
**File Modified**: `src/hooks/useWikiGeneration.ts`
**Solution**: Replaced simple prompt with comprehensive XML format template including:
- Repository analysis instructions with file tree and README context
- Explicit XML structure requirements with `<wiki_structure>` tags
- Detailed formatting guidelines preventing markdown code block wrapping
- Language-specific generation instructions
- Page count specifications for comprehensive vs concise wikis

**Key Changes**:
- **Before**: Simple message `'Determine wiki structure based on repository analysis'`
- **After**: Detailed 80+ line prompt template with complete XML formatting instructions
- **XML Requirements**: Explicit `<wiki_structure>` wrapper with structured `<title>`, `<description>`, `<pages>` elements
- **Format Prevention**: Clear instructions to avoid markdown code blocks and explanation text

**Result**: Wiki refresh now correctly generates and parses XML responses, restoring full functionality

## Key Technical Improvements (September 9, 2025)

### **Frontend Refactoring MAJOR ACHIEVEMENT - COMPLETED** 
- **Transformation**: Complete architectural overhaul from monolithic to modular component system
- **Scale**: Restructured 2,357-line repository page into clean modular architecture
- **Impact**: Enterprise-grade maintainability with component extraction and modern React patterns
- **Achievement**: Solved critical maintainability issues identified in large frontend components

#### **Architectural Transformation Details**
1. **Component Extraction**: Extracted massive `[owner]/[repo]/page.tsx` (2,357 lines) into specialized components:
   - **RepoPageOrchestrator**: Main page orchestration and state management
   - **RepositoryHeader**: Repository metadata and action controls
   - **WikiSidebar**: Navigation and sidebar functionality
   - **WikiViewer**: Content display and interaction

2. **Modern React Architecture**: Implemented enterprise patterns:
   - **Custom Hooks**: `useWikiGeneration` for complex state management
   - **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript definitions in `src/types/shared/wiki.ts`
   - **Utility Functions**: Shared helpers in `src/utils/shared/wikiHelpers.ts`
   - **Component Composition**: Clean separation of concerns

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Achieved through:
   - **Modular Architecture**: Each component has single responsibility
   - **Shared Types**: Consistent interfaces across components
   - **Utility Extraction**: Common operations moved to reusable functions
   - **State Management**: Centralized via custom hooks

4. **Development Experience**: Improved through:
   - **Smaller Files**: Much easier to navigate and understand
   - **Clear Structure**: Logical component hierarchy
   - **Testability**: Components can be tested in isolation
   - **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different contexts

### **Reference Source Hyperlink Fix - COMPLETED** 
- **Problem Solved**: 404 errors on citation links due to branch mismatch (main vs master) and non-existent file references
- **Root Cause**: System using incorrect default branch and no file validation before creating citations
- **Solution Implemented**: Comprehensive branch detection and file validation system

#### **Technical Implementation Details**
1. **Branch Detection System**: Enhanced `src/app/[owner]/[repo]/page.tsx`
   - **Automatic branch detection**: Real-time GitHub API calls to detect repository default branch
   - **Fallback mechanism**: Uses `main` if detection fails
   - **Console validation**: Logs show correct branch detection (`"Found default branch: master"`)
   - **Citation integration**: AI prompts use correct branch for all generated citations

2. **File Validation Framework**: 
   - **Repository file enumeration**: Fetches complete file list from repository structure
   - **AI prompt integration**: Provides actual file list to AI to prevent non-existent file citations
   - **Size optimization**: Limits file list to prevent token overflow
   - **Multi-platform support**: Works with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket

3. **Citation URL Generation**: Multi-platform URL formatting
   - **GitHub**: `https://github.com/owner/repo/blob/master/path#L15-L70`
   - **GitLab**: `https://gitlab.com/owner/repo/-/blob/master/path#L15-L70`
   - **Bitbucket**: `https://bitbucket.org/owner/repo/src/master/path#lines-15:70`

4. **Enhanced Error Prevention**: 
   - **Real-time validation**: Repository structure fetched during wiki generation
   - **File existence checking**: AI receives list of actual repository files
   - **Branch synchronization**: All citations use detected default branch

#### **Verification and Testing**
- ✅ **Branch detection working**: Console logs confirm `"Found default branch: master"`
- ✅ **File validation active**: System correctly identifies repository contains 17 files
- ✅ **Fresh wiki generation**: Successfully tested cache clearing and regeneration
- ✅ **Citation URL format**: Links use correct branch and actual file paths
- ✅ **Multi-platform support**: Solution works for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket
- ✅ **Code cleanup**: Removed unused API endpoint to avoid confusion

#### **User Experience Impact**
- **Before**: Citation links returned 404 errors (incorrect branch and non-existent files)
- **After**: All citation links work correctly and point to actual repository files
- **Reliability**: No more broken reference source hyperlinks in generated documentation
- **Accuracy**: Citations only reference files that actually exist in the repository

### **Mermaid Diagram Fix - Comprehensive Solution**
- **Problem Solved**: Parse error with malformed node syntax (e.g., `Memory[Memo`, `LLM[Language Model (LLM)]`)
- **Root Cause**: Unquoted special characters in Mermaid node labels causing parser failures
- **Solution Implemented**: Multi-layered fix approach

#### **Technical Implementation Details**
1. **Preprocessing Function**: Added `preprocessMermaidChart()` in `src/components/Mermaid.tsx`
   - **Single comprehensive regex**: `/(\w+)\[([^\]]*?)(?:\]|$|\n)/gm` handles all bracket patterns
   - **Intelligent quoting**: Automatically quotes node text containing spaces, parentheses, or special characters
   - **Incomplete bracket fixing**: Handles patterns like `Memory[Memo` (missing closing bracket)
   - **Preserves existing formatting**: Leaves properly quoted nodes unchanged

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: 
   - **Detailed error display**: Shows both original and cleaned chart for debugging
   - **Helpful error messages**: Clear indication of syntax issues with visual comparison
   - **Graceful degradation**: Application continues to function even with malformed diagrams

3. **Prompt Improvements**: Updated generation guidelines in `src/app/[owner]/[repo]/page.tsx`
   - **Specific syntax rules**: Clear examples of proper node naming conventions
   - **Prevention guidelines**: Helps AI generate correct syntax from the start

4. **Code Optimization**: 
   - **Eliminated duplication**: Replaced 3 separate regex operations with single comprehensive function
   - **Improved performance**: Single-pass processing instead of multiple iterations
   - **Better maintainability**: Centralized logic reduces complexity and potential conflicts

#### **Test Coverage and Validation**
- ✅ **Unit testing**: All test cases pass for various malformed syntax patterns
- ✅ **Build validation**: Successful compilation with zero errors
- ✅ **Functionality preserved**: Existing diagrams continue to render correctly
- ✅ **Error cases handled**: Graceful handling of syntax errors with helpful debugging information
