# [TASK012] - Phase 5.2: Endpoints (From api.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 5 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** API Layer Refactoring (Week 5)

## Original Request
Split API endpoints from api.py into domain-specific files and extract shared dependencies to a common module.

## Thought Process
The api.py file contains all API endpoints mixed together, making it difficult to maintain and navigate. This task involves splitting the endpoints into domain-specific modules (chat, wiki, projects) while maintaining all existing functionality and preserving the API contract.

This is a critical task as it directly affects the API structure and any mistakes could break the application's external interface.

## Implementation Plan
- Split endpoints into domain-specific files
- Extract shared dependencies to common module
- Preserve all existing endpoint functionality
- Maintain API versioning structure

| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 5.2.1 | Split endpoints into domain-specific files | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Domain separation |
| 5.2.2 | Create `api/v1/chat.py` for chat endpoints | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Chat API endpoints |
| 5.2.3 | Create `api/v1/wiki.py` for wiki endpoints | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Wiki API endpoints |
| 5.2.4 | Create `api/v1/projects.py` for project endpoints | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Project API endpoints |
| 5.2.5 | Extract dependencies to `api/dependencies.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Shared endpoint dependencies |
| 5.2.6 | Test all API endpoints functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate API operations |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 5.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for endpoint extraction and organization
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK011: Models should be extracted and available
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Endpoints split into domain-specific files
- [ ] All domain-specific endpoint files created
- [ ] Shared dependencies extracted properly
- [ ] All API endpoints continue to function
- [ ] API contract preserved exactly
- [ ] Endpoint tests pass

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Breaking API endpoints could affect application functionality
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all endpoints after extraction
- **Potential Issue**: Shared dependencies could be missed
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of dependency usage across endpoints
