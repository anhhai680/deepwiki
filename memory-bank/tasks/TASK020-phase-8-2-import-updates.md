# [TASK020] - Phase 8.2: Import Updates

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 8 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Testing and Migration (Week 8)

## Original Request
Update all import statements, fix circular imports, and validate module paths.

## Thought Process
After all components have been extracted and moved, there will be numerous import statements throughout the codebase that need to be updated to reflect the new module structure. This is a critical task that must be done carefully to ensure the application continues to function.

Circular imports are a particular concern when reorganizing code, and we need to identify and resolve any that may have been introduced during the restructuring process.

## Implementation Plan
- Update all import statements to reflect new structure
- Identify and fix any circular import issues
- Validate that all module paths are correct
- Ensure all imports resolve properly

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 8.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for import statement updates
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- All component extraction tasks must be completed
- TASK019: Test structure should be available for validation

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All import statements updated correctly
- [ ] No circular imports remain
- [ ] All module paths validated
- [ ] Import resolution tested
- [ ] Import validation script created
- [ ] Application starts without import errors

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Incorrect imports could break the entire application
- **Mitigation**: Systematic approach to import updates with testing
- **Potential Issue**: Circular imports could be difficult to resolve
- **Mitigation**: Use dependency injection and careful module organization
