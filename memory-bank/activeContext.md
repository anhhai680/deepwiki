# Active Context - DeepWiki Project

## Current Session Focus
**API Restructure Phase 1.2** - âœ… **COMPLETED** - Core infrastructure components extracted from existing code.

## Immediate Priorities
1. âœ… **API Restructure Phase 1.1** - Directory structure and foundation completed
2. âœ… **API Restructure Phase 1.2** - Core infrastructure extraction completed
3. ðŸŽ¯ **API Restructure Phase 2** - Begin component extraction (generators, embedders, retrievers)
4. âœ… **Memory Bank Maintenance** - Keep documentation updated with progress

## Current Work Context
- **Phase**: API Restructure Implementation
- **Focus Area**: Phase 1.2 - Core Infrastructure Extraction
- **User Request**: "Execute task @TASK003-phase-1-2-core-infrastructure.md"
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED**

## Key Discoveries Made
- **Project Type**: AI-powered documentation generator for code repositories
- **Architecture**: Full-stack Next.js + FastAPI application
- **AI Integration**: Multi-provider LLM support (Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Azure, Ollama)
- **Core Features**: RAG-powered Q&A, Mermaid diagrams, multi-language support
- **Technology Stack**: Modern React 19, TypeScript, Python FastAPI, Docker
- **Pydantic Version**: Project uses Pydantic 2.11.7, requiring compatibility considerations

## Recent Analysis
- **README.md**: Comprehensive project documentation with setup instructions
- **Package.json**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **API Structure**: FastAPI backend with multiple AI client integrations
- **Frontend**: Sophisticated UI with configuration modals and real-time features
- **Configuration**: Complex configuration system with environment variable substitution
- **Logging**: Advanced logging with custom filters and rotation
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error handling system throughout codebase

## Next Steps
1. âœ… **Directory Structure Complete** - All directories and packages created
2. âœ… **Dependency Injection Framework** - Container structure established
3. âœ… **Placeholder Files Created** - Core components ready for content extraction
4. âœ… **Core Infrastructure Extracted** - Configuration, logging, exceptions, and types extracted
5. ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Phase 2** - Begin extracting component-specific functionality (generators, embedders, retrievers)

## Session Notes
- **User**: Requested execution of TASK003 (Extract Core Infrastructure)
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction of core infrastructure components from existing code
- **Focus**: Establishing solid foundation for API restructure with working components
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Core infrastructure fully extracted and functional

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully completed Phase 1.2 of the API restructure, extracting all core infrastructure components from the existing monolithic files. The extracted components include:

- **Configuration Management**: Complete configuration system with Pydantic 2.x compatibility
- **Logging Setup**: Advanced logging with custom filters and rotation
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive exception hierarchy with utility functions
- **Type Definitions**: All API model types and data structures
- **Configuration Manager**: Centralized interface for configuration management

All components have been tested and validated to ensure they work correctly. The foundation is now solid for Phase 2, which will focus on extracting component-specific functionality (generators, embedders, retrievers) using this established infrastructure.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Pydantic 2.x Compatibility**: Successfully handled version differences with fallback support
2. **Import Structure**: Resolved circular import issues with proper module organization
3. **Environment Variables**: Preserved all existing environment variable handling
4. **Configuration Loading**: Maintained JSON configuration file loading with environment substitution
5. **Type Safety**: Preserved all existing type definitions and relationships
6. **Error Handling**: Enhanced exception system with comprehensive error types
7. **Logging**: Maintained advanced logging features like rotation and custom filters

The core infrastructure is now fully extracted and functional, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of the API restructure.
