**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant

## Original Request
Move prompts from prompts.py to components/generator/templates/templates.py and organize prompt management.

## Thought Process
The prompts.py file (192 lines) contains prompt templates that are used by the generation system. These should be moved to the generator component structure to keep related functionality together and improve organization.

This is a relatively straightforward move but important for keeping the generator components properly organized.

## Implementation Plan
- Move prompt templates to generator component structure
- Organize prompt management within templates module
- Preserve all existing prompt functionality
- Improve prompt organization and accessibility
