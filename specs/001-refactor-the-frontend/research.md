# Research: Frontend Refactoring Approach

**Date**: September 9, 2025  
**Context**: Refactoring 7 critical oversized React/TypeScript files (533-2,357 lines each)

## Research Tasks Completed

### 1. React Component Splitting Best Practices

**Decision**: Extract by concern separation (UI, logic, data, types)  
**Rationale**: 
- Follows React best practices for maintainable components
- Enables better testing and reusability
- Preserves existing functionality while improving structure
- Supports gradual migration without breaking changes

**Alternatives Considered**:
- File-size-only splitting: Rejected (could break logical cohesion)
- Complete rewrite: Rejected (high risk, violates no-breaking-change requirement)
- Monolithic optimization: Rejected (doesn't solve maintainability)

### 2. TypeScript Interface Consolidation

**Decision**: Create shared type modules with backward-compatible exports  
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates duplicate interface definitions found across large files
- Maintains existing import patterns via re-exports
- Enables better type safety and consistency
- Supports gradual adoption

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Global type declarations: Rejected (reduces type safety)
- Per-component types: Rejected (increases duplication)
- Immediate migration: Rejected (too disruptive)

### 3. Custom Hook Extraction Strategy

**Decision**: Extract stateful logic into focused custom hooks  
**Rationale**:
- Separates business logic from presentation logic
- Enables better testing of complex state management
- Improves reusability across components
- Maintains existing component behavior

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Keep inline state: Rejected (maintains complexity)
- External state management: Rejected (over-engineering for refactor)
- Class-based refactor: Rejected (modern React uses hooks)

### 4. Large File Specific Strategies

#### 4.1 Repository Page (2,357 lines)
**Decision**: Split into layout + feature sections + shared utilities  
**Rationale**: File contains multiple distinct features that can be cleanly separated

#### 4.2 Ask Component (1,062 lines)
**Decision**: Separate chat UI, model selection, and websocket logic  
**Rationale**: Clear separation of concerns with minimal interface changes

#### 4.3 Mermaid Component (624 lines)
**Decision**: Extract theme configuration and rendering logic  
**Rationale**: Large theme object and rendering code can be modularized

#### 4.4 User Selector (533 lines)
**Decision**: Split model selection UI from configuration logic  
**Rationale**: Complex form logic can be separated from presentation

### 5. Module Organization Patterns

**Decision**: Feature-based grouping with shared utilities  
**Rationale**:
- Aligns with Next.js App Router structure
- Enables easy location of related code
- Supports incremental refactoring
- Maintains existing import paths via index files

**Structure**:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── ui/           # Shared UI components
│   ├── forms/        # Form-related components
│   └── diagrams/     # Mermaid and visualization
├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
├── types/            # Shared TypeScript definitions
├── utils/            # Utility functions
└── constants/        # Configuration and constants
```

### 6. Migration Strategy

**Decision**: Incremental file-by-file refactoring with compatibility layer  
**Rationale**:
- Minimizes risk of breaking changes
- Allows thorough testing of each refactored component
- Enables rollback if issues are discovered
- Maintains development velocity

**Process**:
1. Extract utilities and types first (lowest risk)
2. Create new modular components alongside existing ones
3. Update imports gradually with backward compatibility
4. Remove old implementations only after thorough testing

### 7. Testing Approach

**Decision**: Preserve existing tests, add new tests for extracted modules  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures no regression in functionality
- Validates extracted modules work in isolation
- Maintains confidence in refactoring process

**Test Strategy**:
- Component behavior tests (existing functionality preserved)
- Hook unit tests (extracted logic works correctly)
- Integration tests (modules work together)
- Visual regression tests (UI unchanged)

## Resolved Technical Questions

### Bundle Size Impact
**Research**: Analyzed current bundle and identified dead code elimination opportunities  
**Result**: Refactoring should maintain or slightly improve bundle size through better tree-shaking

### Performance Implications  
**Research**: Reviewed React rendering patterns and code-splitting opportunities  
**Result**: No negative performance impact expected, potential for improvement via lazy loading

### Backward Compatibility
**Research**: Analyzed existing import patterns and component usage  
**Result**: Can maintain 100% backward compatibility via re-export patterns

## Implementation Confidence Level
**High** - All technical questions resolved, clear strategy established, minimal risk approach validated.
