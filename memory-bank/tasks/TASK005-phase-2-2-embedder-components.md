# [TASK005] - Phase 2.2: Embedder Components (From tools/embedder.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 2 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Component Extraction (Week 2)

## Original Request
Extract and enhance embedder components from the existing tools/embedder.py file and organize them into a proper component structure.

## Thought Process
The current embedder implementation is minimal (only 20 lines) but serves as the foundation for the embedding functionality. This task involves extracting the existing logic and expanding it into a proper component system with provider-specific embedders and a unified interface.

While the current file is small, the embedder functionality is critical for the RAG system, and we need to create a structure that can support multiple embedding providers and enhanced functionality.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract existing embedder logic to component structure
- Create provider-specific embedders based on client code patterns
- Implement unified embedder interface
- Set foundation for enhanced embedding capabilities

## Progress Tracking

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2.2.1 | Extract embedder logic to `components/embedder/embedder_manager.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Main embedder management |
| 2.2.2 | Create provider-specific embedders based on existing client code | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Provider-specific implementations |
| 2.2.3 | Create `components/embedder/base.py` interface | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Unified embedder interface |
| 2.2.4 | Implement embedding provider detection and selection | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Dynamic provider selection |
| 2.2.5 | Test embedder components with existing functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate extracted functionality |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 2.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for embedder extraction and enhancement
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be in place
- TASK004: Generator components may provide patterns to follow

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Embedder logic extracted and organized properly
- [ ] Provider-specific embedders implemented
- [ ] Unified embedder interface created
- [ ] Embedder manager provides consistent access
- [ ] All existing embedding functionality preserved
- [ ] Foundation set for future enhancements

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: Small existing file makes extraction straightforward
- **Potential Issue**: Provider-specific logic may need to be inferred
- **Mitigation**: Use generator component patterns as reference
