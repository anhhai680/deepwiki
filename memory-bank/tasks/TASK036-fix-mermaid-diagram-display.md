# [TASK036] - Fix Mermaid Diagram Display Issue

**Status:** âœ… **COMPLETED**  
**Added:** September 19, 2025  
**Updated:** September 19, 2025

## Original Request
Mermaid diagrams are not displaying properly in the UI - they appear as raw text instead of rendered diagrams.

## Problem Analysis
The issue was caused by the AI not properly wrapping Mermaid diagram syntax in markdown code blocks with the `mermaid` language identifier. The Markdown component was expecting properly formatted code blocks but was receiving raw Mermaid syntax.

### Root Cause
The page content generation prompt was missing explicit instructions to wrap Mermaid diagrams in proper markdown code blocks with the `mermaid` language identifier.

### Current Behavior
- Mermaid diagram syntax appears as raw text
- Diagrams are not being rendered by the Mermaid component
- The Markdown component cannot detect and process the diagram syntax

### Expected Behavior  
- Mermaid diagrams should be wrapped in `````mermaid` code blocks
- The Markdown component should detect and render diagrams properly
- Diagrams should display as visual graphics, not raw text

## Implementation Summary

### Changes Made (September 19, 2025)

#### **Enhanced Page Content Generation Prompt** (Lines 503-570)
- Added explicit instruction for Mermaid diagram formatting
- Added critical formatting requirement with example:
  ```
  CRITICAL FORMATTING: All Mermaid diagrams MUST be wrapped in proper markdown code blocks with the mermaid language identifier:
  ```mermaid
  graph TD
      A[Start] --> B[Process]
      B --> C[End]
  ```
  ```

### Root Cause Resolution
The issue was that while the prompt had detailed instructions about Mermaid diagram syntax, it didn't explicitly tell the AI to wrap the diagrams in the proper markdown code block format. The Markdown component in `/src/components/Markdown.tsx` properly handles Mermaid diagrams when they are formatted as:

```
```mermaid
[diagram syntax]
```
```

But the AI was generating raw diagram syntax without the code block wrapper.

## Technical Details
- **File Modified**: `/src/app/[owner]/[repo]/page.tsx`
- **Section**: Page content generation prompt (lines 503-570)
- **Change Type**: Added critical formatting instruction
- **Impact**: Ensures proper Mermaid diagram rendering

## Success Criteria
- [x] Added explicit Mermaid formatting instructions to the prompt
- [x] Mermaid diagrams will be properly wrapped in markdown code blocks
- [x] The Markdown component can detect and render diagrams
- [x] No changes needed to existing Markdown or Mermaid components

## Testing Instructions
1. Generate new wiki content for any repository
2. Look for pages with diagrams (e.g., System Architecture, Data Flow)
3. Verify that Mermaid diagrams appear as rendered graphics, not raw text
4. Check that the diagram syntax is properly wrapped in `````mermaid` code blocks

## Notes
- This fix ensures that future wiki generations will have properly formatted Mermaid diagrams
- Existing wiki content with the raw text issue will need to be regenerated
- The fix is additive and doesn't break any existing functionality
