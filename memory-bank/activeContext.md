## Session Notes
- **User**: Requested execution of TASK006 (Extract Retriever and Memory Components)
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction of retriever and memory components following established patterns
- **Focus**: Establishing unified interface for all RAG components while preserving functionality
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Retriever and memory components fully extracted and functional

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully completed Phase 2.3 of the API restructure, extracting all retriever and memory components from the existing rag.py file. The extracted components include:

- **Base Retriever Interface**: `BaseRetriever` abstract class with common methods and types
- **FAISS Retriever**: Complete FAISS integration with enhanced error handling and embedding validation
- **Vector Store**: Dedicated component for document and embedding management
- **Conversation Memory**: Enhanced memory component with auto-cleanup and turn limits
- **Retriever Manager**: Centralized retriever management and orchestration
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the system
- **Embedding Validation**: All existing embedding validation and filtering logic preserved
- **Backward Compatibility**: Compatibility layer that maintains existing rag.py interface

All components have been tested and validated to ensure they work correctly. The retriever and memory system is now unified and ready for Phase 2.4, which will focus on extracting the next phase of components using this established pattern.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Unified Interface**: Successfully created `BaseRetriever` abstract class that all retriever implementations implement
2. **FAISS Integration**: Extracted and preserved all FAISS retriever logic with enhanced error handling
3. **Vector Store**: Created dedicated vector store component for document and embedding management
4. **Memory Management**: Extracted conversation memory with enhanced features like auto-cleanup and turn limits
5. **Manager Pattern**: Created centralized `RetrieverManager` for retriever orchestration
6. **Error Handling**: Maintained comprehensive error handling throughout the system
7. **Embedding Validation**: Preserved all embedding validation and filtering logic
8. **Backward Compatibility**: Created compatibility layer that maintains existing rag.py interface
9. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite that validates all components
10. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout

The retriever and memory components are now fully extracted and functional, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of the API restructure.
