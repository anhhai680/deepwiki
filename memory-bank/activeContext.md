## Session Notes
- **User**: Requested execution of TASK017 (WebSocket)
- **Approach**: Systematic relocation of WebSocket functionality from monolithic file to organized module structure
- **Focus**: Moving WebSocket functionality while preserving all existing features and updating imports
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETED** - 100% Complete - All WebSocket functionality moved, organized, and tested

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully implemented Phase 7.2 of the API restructure, moving WebSocket functionality from the monolithic `websocket_wiki.py` file to the new organized `websocket/wiki_handler.py` module structure. The implemented WebSocket functionality includes:

- **Multi-Provider AI Support**: Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Azure, and Dashscope integration
- **RAG-Powered Responses**: Document retrieval, context building, and intelligent responses
- **Deep Research Functionality**: Multi-iteration research process with conversation continuity
- **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket streaming responses and connection management
- **File Integration**: File content retrieval and context-aware responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms

All WebSocket functionality has been preserved, organized into a clean module structure, and imports have been updated throughout the codebase. The WebSocket module now provides a clean, organized interface for real-time communication while maintaining full backward compatibility. The system is ready for Phase 7.3, which will focus on Prompts functionality.

## Technical Achievements
1. **WebSocket Module Architecture**: Successfully created organized WebSocket module structure
2. **Functionality Preservation**: Maintained all existing WebSocket functionality including multi-provider AI support
3. **Module Organization**: Organized WebSocket functionality into clean, maintainable module structure
4. **Import Management**: Updated all import statements throughout the codebase to use new module structure
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensured all existing functionality continues to work without changes
6. **Code Organization**: Eliminated monolithic file structure in favor of organized modules
7. **Module Exports**: Properly configured module exports for clean import interface
8. **File Cleanup**: Removed old websocket_wiki.py file after successful migration
9. **Testing Validation**: Verified successful imports and module functionality
10. **Quality Assurance**: Established WebSocket module as production-ready foundation

The WebSocket functionality is now fully organized into a clean module structure while maintaining all existing features. This establishes a solid foundation for the WebSocket layer and prepares the system for the next phase of the API restructure.
