# [TASK017] - Phase 7.2: WebSocket (From websocket_wiki.py)

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Completed (100%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 7 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Utilities and WebSocket (Week 7)

## Original Request
Move WebSocket functionality from websocket_wiki.py to websocket/wiki_handler.py while preserving existing functionality and maintaining connection management.

## Thought Process
The websocket_wiki.py file (770 lines) contains WebSocket handling logic that needs to be moved to the new websocket module structure. This functionality is important for real-time communication with the frontend and must be preserved exactly.

The WebSocket handling includes connection management, message processing, and real-time updates that are critical to the user experience.

## Implementation Plan
- Move WebSocket logic to new websocket module
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Maintain connection management capabilities
- Ensure real-time functionality continues to work

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 7.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for WebSocket functionality relocation
- Ready for implementation to begin

### 2025-08-28
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Successfully moved WebSocket functionality from `websocket_wiki.py` to `websocket/wiki_handler.py`
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Preserved all existing WebSocket functionality including:
  - Multi-provider AI model support (Google, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Ollama, Azure, Dashscope)
  - RAG-powered document retrieval and context building
  - Deep Research functionality with multi-iteration support
  - Real-time streaming responses
  - Connection management and error handling
  - File content integration and conversation history
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Updated websocket module `__init__.py` to export all necessary functions and classes
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Updated all import statements in:
  - `api/api.py` - Main API file
  - `api/api/v1/chat.py` - Chat endpoints
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Verified successful imports and module functionality
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: Removed old `websocket_wiki.py` file (no longer needed)
- âœ… **COMPLETED**: All WebSocket functionality now accessible via `api.websocket` module

## Dependencies
- âœ… TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- âœ… TASK013: App configuration should be updated to reference new location

## Success Criteria
- âœ… WebSocket logic moved to new module structure
- âœ… All existing functionality preserved
- âœ… Connection management maintained
- âœ… Import statements updated correctly
- âœ… WebSocket communication working properly
- âœ… Real-time features functioning

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: WebSocket functionality is complex and critical
- **Mitigation**: âœ… Careful testing of all WebSocket operations completed
- **Potential Issue**: Connection management could be disrupted
- **Mitigation**: âœ… Thorough testing of connection lifecycle completed

## Summary
TASK017 has been successfully completed. The WebSocket functionality has been successfully moved from the monolithic `websocket_wiki.py` file to the new organized `websocket/wiki_handler.py` module structure. All functionality has been preserved, imports have been updated, and the system is ready for production use. The WebSocket module now provides a clean, organized interface for real-time communication while maintaining full backward compatibility.
