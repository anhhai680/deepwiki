# [TASK014] - Phase 6.1: Data Processing (From data_pipeline.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 6 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Data Layer (Week 6)

## Original Request
Extract data processors from data_pipeline.py to components/processors/ and extract database logic to data/database.py, plus create repository base class.

## Thought Process
The data_pipeline.py file (842 lines) contains multiple types of logic including data processing, database operations, and business logic. This task focuses on extracting the data processing components and database logic to create a clean data layer.

The extraction will separate data processing concerns from business logic and create reusable processor components that can be used throughout the system.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract data processors to dedicated components
- Extract database logic to data layer
- Create repository base class for data access patterns
- Preserve all data processing capabilities

| 6.1.4 | Organize processor types (text, code, document) | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Processor specialization |
| 6.1.5 | Test extracted data processing functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate data operations |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 6.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for data processing extraction
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Data processors extracted to components
- [ ] Database logic extracted to data layer
- [ ] Repository base class created
- [ ] Processor types properly organized
- [ ] All data processing functionality preserved
- [ ] Data layer patterns established

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Complex data processing logic may be difficult to extract
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of data flow before extraction
- **Potential Issue**: Database operations could be disrupted
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of database functionality
