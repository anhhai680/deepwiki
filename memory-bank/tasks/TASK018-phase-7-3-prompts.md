# [TASK018] - Phase 7.3: Prompts (From prompts.py)

**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ Completed (100%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 7 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Utilities and WebSocket (Week 7)

## Original Request
Move prompts from prompts.py to components/generator/templates/templates.py and organize prompt management.

## Thought Process
The prompts.py file (192 lines) contains prompt templates that are used by the generation system. These should be moved to the generator component structure to keep related functionality together and improve organization.

This is a relatively straightforward move but important for keeping the generator components properly organized.

## Implementation Plan
- Move prompt templates to generator component structure
- Organize prompt management within templates module
- Preserve all existing prompt functionality
- Improve prompt organization and accessibility

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100%

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 7.3.1 | Move to `components/generator/templates/templates.py` | Completed | 2025-08-28 | Moved prompts and created module |
| 7.3.2 | Organize prompt management | Completed | 2025-08-28 | Re-exported via `templates/__init__.py` |
| 7.3.3 | Preserve existing prompt functionality | Completed | 2025-08-28 | Templates unchanged, centralized |
| 7.3.4 | Update imports and references | Completed | 2025-08-28 | Updated all references to new path |
| 7.3.5 | Test prompt template functionality | Completed | 2025-08-28 | Imports and dependent tests pass; unrelated tests failing |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 7.3 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for prompt template relocation
- Ready for implementation to begin

### 2025-08-28
- Implemented prompt relocation to `api/components/generator/templates/templates.py`
- Added exports in `api/components/generator/templates/__init__.py`
- Updated imports in `api/pipelines/rag/steps/response_generation.py`, `api/rag.py`, `api/pipelines/chat/steps.py`, and `api/simple_chat.py`
- Removed `api/prompts.py`
- Ran test suite; prompt-related functionality works. Remaining failures are unrelated to prompts (retriever tests and an API fixture).

## Dependencies
- TASK004: Generator components should be available
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created

## Success Criteria
- [x] Prompt templates moved to generator component structure
- [x] Prompt management organized properly
- [x] All existing prompt functionality preserved
- [x] Import statements updated correctly
- [x] Prompt templates working in new location
- [x] Template organization improved

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: Prompt relocation is typically straightforward
- **Potential Issue**: Template references could be missed
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of template usage
