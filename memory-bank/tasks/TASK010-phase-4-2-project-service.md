# [TASK010] - Phase 4.2: Project Service (From data_pipeline.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 4 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Service Layer (Week 4)

## Original Request
Extract project processing logic from data_pipeline.py to create a dedicated project service while maintaining existing processing capabilities.

## Thought Process
The data_pipeline.py file (842 lines) contains significant project processing logic mixed with data processing operations. This task focuses on extracting the project-specific business logic and organizing it into a proper service layer component.

The project service will handle project-level operations like indexing, analysis, and management while delegating data processing tasks to appropriate components.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract project processing logic from data_pipeline.py
- Create dedicated project service
- Maintain existing processing capabilities
- Implement service layer patterns

## Progress Tracking

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 4.2.1 | Extract project processing to `services/project_service.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Project-level business logic |
| 4.2.2 | Maintain existing processing capabilities | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Preserve all functionality |
| 4.2.3 | Implement service layer patterns | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Consistent service architecture |
| 4.2.4 | Integrate with data processing components | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Connect to data layer |
| 4.2.5 | Test project service functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate service operations |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 4.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for project service extraction and implementation
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be available
- Future data layer tasks for integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Project processing logic extracted to service layer
- [ ] All existing processing capabilities maintained
- [ ] Service layer patterns implemented consistently
- [ ] Integration with data components working
- [ ] All project service functionality preserved
- [ ] Clear separation between service and data layers

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Large data_pipeline.py file may have complex interdependencies
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of dependencies before extraction
- **Potential Issue**: Processing capabilities could be lost
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing of all processing scenarios
