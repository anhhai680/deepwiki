# [TASK025] - Mobile Responsiveness Optimization

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 5, 2025  
**Updated:** September 5, 2025

## Original Request
Optimize the mobile responsiveness of the new two-column layout to ensure excellent user experience across all device sizes and screen orientations.

## Thought Process
While the basic mobile responsiveness has been implemented with tab navigation, there are opportunities to further optimize the mobile experience:
1. Fine-tune breakpoints for different device sizes
2. Optimize touch interactions and gestures
3. Improve loading performance on mobile devices
4. Enhance accessibility for mobile screen readers
5. Test across various mobile devices and browsers

This task focuses on ensuring that the improved desktop experience translates effectively to mobile devices.

## Implementation Plan
- Conduct comprehensive mobile device testing
- Optimize breakpoints and responsive behavior
- Enhance touch interaction patterns
- Improve mobile performance metrics
- Validate accessibility compliance
- Cross-browser mobile testing

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% completion
