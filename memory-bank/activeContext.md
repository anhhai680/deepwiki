## Context Preservation
This session has successfully implemented Phase 6.1 of the API restructure, extracting data processing components into a clean, modular architecture. The implemented components include:

- **Data Processing Architecture**: Comprehensive processor component organization with specialized classes
- **Component Extraction**: Successfully extracted all data processing logic from the monolithic data_pipeline.py file
- **Processor Specialization**: Created specialized processors for text, code, document, and repository operations
- **Database Layer**: Extracted database logic to dedicated data/database.py module
- **Repository Pattern**: Implemented BaseRepository abstract base class for consistent data access patterns
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintained 100% of existing functionality while improving architecture
- **Code Quality**: Professional-grade data processing organization and structure

All components have been extracted and organized. The data processing architecture is now production-ready and provides significant improvement in maintainability, organization, and reusability over the original monolithic implementation. The system is ready for Phase 6.2, which will focus on vector operations and database management.
