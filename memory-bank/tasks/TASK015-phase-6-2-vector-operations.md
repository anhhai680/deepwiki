# [TASK015] - Phase 6.2: Vector Operations

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 6 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Data Layer (Week 6)

## Original Request
Extract vector operations to data/vector_store.py and maintain existing FAISS integration.

## Thought Process
Vector operations are currently embedded within the RAG system but need to be extracted to a dedicated data layer component. This will create a clean separation between vector storage operations and retrieval logic while maintaining the existing FAISS integration.

The vector store will become a foundational component that can be used by different parts of the system for vector storage and retrieval operations.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract vector operations from existing code
- Create dedicated vector store component
- Maintain FAISS integration
- Ensure compatibility with retrieval components

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 6.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for vector operations extraction
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK006: Retriever components should be available for integration
- TASK014: Data layer foundation should be established

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Vector operations extracted to data layer
- [ ] FAISS integration maintained
- [ ] Vector store interface created
- [ ] Integration with retrievers working
- [ ] All vector functionality preserved
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Vector operations are performance-critical
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing of performance after extraction
- **Potential Issue**: FAISS integration could be broken
- **Mitigation**: Thorough testing of FAISS functionality
