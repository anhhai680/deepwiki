## Session Notes
- **User**: Reported WikiCacheData forward reference error in dependencies.py
- **Issue**: `WikiCacheData` is not fully defined; forward references not resolving in Pydantic v2.11.7
- **Solution**: Updated models with proper Config classes and added model_rebuild() calls
- **Status**: ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETED** - All forward reference issues resolved; models working perfectly

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully resolved the Pydantic forward reference issue that was preventing the WikiCacheData model from working correctly. The solution involved:

- **Forward Reference Resolution**: Updated `api/models/wiki.py` with proper Config classes for forward references
- **Model Rebuild**: Added `model_rebuild()` calls in `api/models/__init__.py` to resolve forward references after import
- **Pydantic v2.11.7 Compatibility**: Ensured all models work correctly with the current Pydantic version
- **Cache Functionality**: Verified that wiki cache reading now works perfectly without errors

The system is now fully functional with all models properly resolved and ready for Phase 8.3 (Final Integration). The WikiCacheData model can successfully read cached data from the file system, and all forward references between models are properly resolved.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Pydantic Forward Reference Fix**: Successfully resolved WikiCacheData forward reference issues
2. **Model Compatibility**: Ensured all models work correctly with Pydantic v2.11.7
3. **Cache Functionality**: Restored wiki cache reading functionality to full operation
4. **Model Architecture**: Maintained clean model organization while fixing compatibility issues
5. **Forward Reference Resolution**: Implemented proper forward reference handling for complex model relationships
6. **Error Resolution**: Eliminated "WikiCacheData is not fully defined" errors
7. **System Stability**: Ensured all model imports and instantiations work correctly
8. **Cache Operations**: Verified successful cache reading operations for existing cached data
9. **Model Relationships**: Maintained proper relationships between WikiCacheData, RepoInfo, and other models
10. **Production Readiness**: System now ready for production use with fully functional models

The Pydantic forward reference issue has been completely resolved, and the system is now ready for the final integration phase. All models are working correctly, and the wiki cache functionality is fully operational.
