# [TASK016] - Phase 7.1: Utilities (From Existing Code)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 7 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Utilities and WebSocket (Week 7)

## Original Request
Extract text processing utilities, file operations from data_pipeline.py, and create validation utilities.

## Thought Process
Throughout the codebase, there are various utility functions scattered across different files. This task focuses on extracting and organizing these utilities into a dedicated utils module where they can be easily found and reused.

The utilities include text processing functions, file operations, and validation logic that can be used across multiple components in the system.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract text processing utilities from various files
- Extract file operations from data_pipeline.py
- Create validation utilities from existing validation code
- Organize utilities for easy discovery and reuse

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Not Started - 0%
