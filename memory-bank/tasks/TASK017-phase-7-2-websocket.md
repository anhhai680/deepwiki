# [TASK017] - Phase 7.2: WebSocket (From websocket_wiki.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 7 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Utilities and WebSocket (Week 7)

## Original Request
Move WebSocket functionality from websocket_wiki.py to websocket/wiki_handler.py while preserving existing functionality and maintaining connection management.

## Thought Process
The websocket_wiki.py file (770 lines) contains WebSocket handling logic that needs to be moved to the new websocket module structure. This functionality is important for real-time communication with the frontend and must be preserved exactly.

The WebSocket handling includes connection management, message processing, and real-time updates that are critical to the user experience.

## Implementation Plan
- Move WebSocket logic to new websocket module
- Preserve all existing functionality
- Maintain connection management capabilities
- Ensure real-time functionality continues to work

## Progress Tracking
