# [TASK002] - Phase 1.1: Create Directory Structure

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 1 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Foundation Setup (Week 1)

## Original Request
Create the new directory structure for the API restructure project, setting up the foundation for the modular architecture.

## Thought Process
This is the foundational step for the API restructure. Before we can extract and reorganize existing code, we need to establish the proper directory structure that will house all the new components. This includes creating all the necessary directories with proper `__init__.py` files and setting up the basic dependency injection structure that will be used throughout the project.

The directory structure follows modern Python project best practices and separates concerns into clear, logical modules. Each directory serves a specific purpose in the overall architecture.

## Implementation Plan
- Create new directory structure with proper organization
- Add `__init__.py` files to make directories proper Python packages
- Set up basic dependency injection framework structure
- Establish foundation for modular architecture

## Progress Tracking

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.1.1 | Create core directory structure (core/, components/, pipelines/, etc.) | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Foundation directories |
| 1.1.2 | Add `__init__.py` files to all new directories | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Make proper Python packages |
| 1.1.3 | Set up basic dependency injection structure | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | DI container foundation |
| 1.1.4 | Create placeholder files for key components | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Prepare for content extraction |
| 1.1.5 | Validate directory structure against plan | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Ensure compliance with design |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 1.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up initial subtask structure
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundation task)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All directories from the new structure are created
- [ ] All directories contain proper `__init__.py` files
- [ ] Basic dependency injection structure is in place
- [ ] Directory structure matches the implementation plan exactly
- [ ] Structure is validated and ready for code extraction

## Risks
- **Low Risk**: This is primarily a directory creation task
- **Potential Issue**: Naming conflicts with existing directories
- **Mitigation**: Careful planning and validation before creation
