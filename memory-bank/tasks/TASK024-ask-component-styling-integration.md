# [TASK024] - Ask Component Styling and Integration Refinements

**Status:** In Progress  
**Added:** September 5, 2025  
**Updated:** September 5, 2025

## Original Request
Enhance the styling and integration of the Ask component within the new two-column home page layout to ensure visual consistency and optimal user experience.

## Thought Process
With the implementation of the two-column layout, the Ask component needed refinements to better integrate within the new design. This includes:
1. Styling adjustments for better visual harmony with the overall layout
2. Enhanced component behavior within the ChatPanel context
3. Improved responsive design considerations
4. Better state management integration

The focus is on polish and refinement rather than functional changes, ensuring the Ask component feels native to the new layout design.

## Implementation Plan
- Refine Ask component styling for layout integration
- Improve visual consistency with other components
- Enhance responsive behavior within ChatPanel
- Optimize component state management
- Ensure seamless user experience transitions
