# Feature Specification: Quick Access Ask UI from Home Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-refactor-frontend-to`  
**Created**: September 4, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Refactor frontend to help users can access Ask UI from home page quickly rather than open each on each repository."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature request: Enable Ask UI access from home page
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identified: home page access, Ask UI, repository selection, quick access
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should Ask UI be embedded directly in home page or opened in modal?] 
   => Answer: Embedded directly in home page
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What repository selection method should be used when no specific repository is loaded?]
   => Answer: Required the users select one of repository has been indexed
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary scenario: User wants to ask questions without navigating to repository wiki first
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement focuses on UI access and repository selection
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Ask UI component, repository selector, home page layout
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN "Spec has uncertainties regarding UI approach and repository selection"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a DeepWiki user, I want to access the Ask AI functionality directly from the home page so that I can ask questions about repositories without first generating a full wiki, enabling faster queries and exploration of multiple repositories.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the DeepWiki home page, **When** I look for Ask functionality, **Then** I should see a clear way to access AI chat capabilities
2. **Given** I access Ask from the home page, **When** I need to select repositories to query, **Then** I should be able to choose from previously processed repositories or enter new repository URLs
3. **Given** I am using Ask from the home page, **When** I ask questions, **Then** I should receive responses about the selected repositories without requiring full wiki generation
4. **Given** I have multiple repositories I want to query, **When** I use Ask from the home page, **Then** I should be able to select multiple repositories simultaneously

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to ask questions without selecting any repository?
- How does the system handle queries about repositories that haven't been processed yet?
- What occurs when a user selects repositories with different access tokens or authentication requirements?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide Ask UI access directly from the home page without requiring repository wiki generation
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select repositories for querying from the home page Ask interface
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to choose from previously processed repositories when using Ask from home page
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to enter new repository URLs directly in the home page Ask interface
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multi-repository selection in the home page Ask interface
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain existing Ask UI functionality when accessed from repository pages
- **FR-007**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a visual indicator showing which repositories are currently selected for querying?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: How should authentication tokens be handled for repositories accessed via home page Ask?]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to switch between single and multi-repository modes in home page Ask?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Ask UI Component**: Interactive chat interface that processes user questions and displays AI responses
- **Repository Selector**: Component that allows users to choose which repositories to query from home page
- **Home Page Layout**: Main application entry point that now includes Ask functionality access
- **Repository Context**: Information about selected repositories including URLs, access tokens, and processing status
