# [TASK023] - UI Layout Enhancement - Home Page Two-Column Design

**Status:** Completed  
**Added:** September 5, 2025  
**Updated:** September 5, 2025

## Original Request
Enhance the home page layout with a two-column design to provide better space utilization and immediate access to Ask functionality while maintaining existing features.

## Thought Process
The current home page layout could be improved to better showcase the dual functionality of DeepWiki: browsing existing projects and asking questions about repositories. A two-column layout would allow users to:
1. View and select from existing processed projects on one side
2. Access the Ask functionality immediately on the other side
3. Maintain responsive design for mobile devices

This enhancement builds on the existing functionality without breaking any core features, focusing purely on improving user experience and interface design.

## Implementation Plan
- Restructure home page with two-column layout
- Create dedicated components for projects panel and chat panel
- Implement responsive design with mobile tab navigation
- Enhance component styling for better visual consistency
- Maintain all existing functionality while improving layout

## Progress Tracking

**Overall Status:** Completed - 100% completion
