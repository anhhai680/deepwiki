# [TASK003] - Phase 1.2: Core Infrastructure (From Existing Code)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 1 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Foundation Setup (Week 1)

## Original Request
Extract core infrastructure components from existing code to establish the foundation layer of the new architecture.

## Thought Process
This task focuses on extracting and reorganizing the fundamental infrastructure pieces from the existing codebase. We need to carefully extract configuration management, logging setup, error handling, and type definitions from the current files and place them in the new core structure. This is critical because these components will be used by all other parts of the system.

The extraction must preserve all existing functionality while organizing it in a more maintainable way. Special attention must be paid to dependencies and ensuring nothing breaks during the extraction process.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract configuration management from `config.py`
- Move logging setup to dedicated module
- Create centralized exception handling
- Organize type definitions in common location

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 1.2.1 | Extract configuration from `config.py` to `core/config/settings.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Core configuration management |
| 1.2.2 | Extract logging setup to `core/config/logging.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Centralized logging configuration |
| 1.2.3 | Create `core/exceptions.py` from existing error handling | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Custom exception classes |
| 1.2.4 | Create `core/types.py` from existing type definitions | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Common type definitions |
| 1.2.5 | Validate extracted components work correctly | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Test extracted functionality |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 1.2 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up initial subtask structure focusing on core infrastructure extraction
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created first

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Configuration extracted from `config.py` and working in new location
- [ ] Logging setup extracted and functional
- [ ] Exception handling centralized and comprehensive
- [ ] Type definitions organized and accessible
- [ ] All extracted components tested and validated
- [ ] No functionality lost during extraction

## Risks
- **Medium Risk**: Configuration extraction may break dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Careful dependency mapping and gradual extraction
- **Potential Issue**: Circular imports during reorganization
- **Mitigation**: Proper import structure and dependency injection
