6. ðŸŽ¯ **Ready for Phase 2.2** - Begin extracting embedder components

## Session Notes
- **User**: Requested execution of TASK004 (Extract Generator Components)
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction of generator components from existing client files
- **Focus**: Establishing unified interface for all AI providers while preserving functionality
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Generator components fully extracted and functional

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully completed Phase 2.1 of the API restructure, extracting all generator components from the existing monolithic client files. The extracted components include:

- **Base Generator Interface**: `BaseGenerator` abstract class with common methods and types
- **Standardized Types**: `ModelType` and `ProviderType` enums for consistency
- **Output Standardization**: `GeneratorOutput` class for consistent response handling
- **Provider Implementations**: All 6 AI providers (OpenAI, Azure, Bedrock, DashScope, OpenRouter, Ollama)
- **Generator Manager**: Centralized provider management and orchestration
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns across all providers
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous operation support
- **Configuration**: All existing configuration options and environment variable support

All components have been tested and validated to ensure they work correctly. The generator system is now unified and ready for Phase 2.2, which will focus on extracting embedder components using this established pattern.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Unified Interface**: Successfully created `BaseGenerator` abstract class that all providers implement
2. **Provider Extraction**: Extracted logic from 6 different client files without losing functionality
3. **Type Standardization**: Implemented consistent enums and output formats across all providers
4. **Manager Pattern**: Created centralized `GeneratorManager` for provider orchestration
5. **Error Handling**: Maintained comprehensive error handling throughout the system
6. **Async Support**: Preserved both sync and async operation capabilities
7. **Configuration**: Maintained all existing configuration options and environment variable support
8. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite that validates all components
9. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout
10. **Core Integration**: Added `CompletionUsage` class to core types for generator support

The generator components are now fully extracted and functional, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of the API restructure.
