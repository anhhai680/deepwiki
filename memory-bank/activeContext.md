## Session Notes
- **User**: Requested execution of TASK005 (Extract Embedder Components)
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction of embedder components following generator component patterns
- **Focus**: Establishing unified interface for all embedding providers while preserving functionality
- **Status**: âœ… **COMPLETED** - Embedder components fully extracted and functional

## Context Preservation
This session has successfully completed Phase 2.2 of the API restructure, extracting all embedder components from the existing tools/embedder.py file. The extracted components include:

- **Base Embedder Interface**: `BaseEmbedder` abstract class with common methods and types
- **Standardized Types**: `EmbeddingModelType` enum for model type classification
- **Output Standardization**: `EmbedderOutput` class for consistent response handling
- **Provider Implementations**: OpenAI and Ollama embedders with consistent behavior
- **Embedder Manager**: Centralized provider management and orchestration
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling patterns across all providers
- **Async Support**: Both synchronous and asynchronous operation support
- **Configuration**: All existing configuration options and environment variable support
- **Backward Compatibility**: Compatibility layer that maintains existing interface

All components have been tested and validated to ensure they work correctly. The embedder system is now unified and ready for Phase 2.3, which will focus on extracting retriever and memory components using this established pattern.

## Technical Achievements
1. **Unified Interface**: Successfully created `BaseEmbedder` abstract class that all providers implement
2. **Provider Extraction**: Extracted logic from existing embedder configuration and client patterns
3. **Type Standardization**: Implemented consistent enums and output formats across all providers
4. **Manager Pattern**: Created centralized `EmbedderManager` for provider orchestration
5. **Error Handling**: Maintained comprehensive error handling throughout the system
6. **Async Support**: Preserved both sync and async operation capabilities
7. **Configuration**: Maintained all existing configuration options and environment variable support
8. **Testing**: Created comprehensive test suite that validates all components
9. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive docstrings and type hints throughout
10. **Backward Compatibility**: Created compatibility layer that maintains existing interface

The embedder components are now fully extracted and functional, providing a solid foundation for the next phase of the API restructure.
