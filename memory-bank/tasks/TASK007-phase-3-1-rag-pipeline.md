# [TASK007] - Phase 3.1: RAG Pipeline (From rag.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 3 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Pipeline Implementation (Week 3)

## Original Request
Extract RAG orchestration logic from rag.py and implement it as a proper pipeline with base framework and context management.

## Thought Process
After extracting the individual RAG components (retriever, vector store, memory), we need to create the pipeline that orchestrates these components together. The current rag.py contains orchestration logic that coordinates retrieval, generation, and memory management.

This task focuses on creating a proper pipeline architecture that can manage the flow of data through the RAG process while providing flexibility for future enhancements.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract RAG orchestration logic to dedicated pipeline
- Create base pipeline framework for reusability
- Implement pipeline context management for data flow
- Ensure seamless integration with extracted components

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 3.1.1 | Extract RAG orchestration to `pipelines/rag/rag_pipeline.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Main RAG pipeline logic |
| 3.1.2 | Create base pipeline framework | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Reusable pipeline foundation |
| 3.1.3 | Implement pipeline context management | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Data flow and state management |
| 3.1.4 | Integrate with extracted RAG components | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Connect retriever, generator, memory |
| 3.1.5 | Test RAG pipeline with existing use cases | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Validate pipeline functionality |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 3.1 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for RAG pipeline extraction and implementation
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK006: Retriever and memory components must be extracted first
- TASK004: Generator components should be available
- TASK005: Embedder components should be available

## Success Criteria
- [ ] RAG orchestration extracted to pipeline structure
- [ ] Base pipeline framework created and reusable
- [ ] Pipeline context management implemented
- [ ] Integration with all RAG components working
- [ ] All existing RAG functionality preserved
- [ ] Pipeline is modular and extensible

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Complex orchestration logic may be difficult to extract cleanly
- **Mitigation**: Careful analysis of data flow before extraction
- **Potential Issue**: Performance overhead from pipeline abstraction
- **Mitigation**: Optimize pipeline for minimal overhead
