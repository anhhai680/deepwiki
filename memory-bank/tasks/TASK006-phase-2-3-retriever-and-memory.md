# [TASK006] - Phase 2.3: Retriever and Memory (From rag.py)

**Status:** ðŸ”´ Not Started (0%)  
**Priority:** ðŸ”´ High  
**Assignee:** AI Assistant  
**Created:** 2025-08-27  
**Due Date:** Week 2 of restructure  
**Category:** ðŸ”§ Development  
**Phase:** Component Extraction (Week 2)

## Original Request
Extract retrieval logic, vector store operations, and conversation memory components from the existing rag.py file.

## Thought Process
The rag.py file (445 lines) contains core RAG functionality including retrieval logic, vector store operations, and conversation memory management. This is one of the most critical extractions as it affects the core functionality of the system.

The extraction needs to be done carefully to preserve all RAG capabilities while organizing the code into logical, maintainable components. The retrieval system and memory management are central to the application's value proposition.

## Implementation Plan
- Extract retrieval logic to dedicated retriever component
- Separate vector store operations into standalone component
- Extract conversation memory to dedicated memory component
- Create base interfaces for all extracted components

### Subtasks
| ID | Description | Status | Updated | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|---------|-------|
| 2.3.1 | Extract retrieval logic to `components/retriever/faiss_retriever.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | FAISS-based retrieval logic |
| 2.3.2 | Extract vector store logic to `components/retriever/vector_store.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Vector database operations |
| 2.3.3 | Extract conversation memory to `components/memory/conversation_memory.py` | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Chat history and context management |
| 2.3.4 | Create base interfaces for retriever, vector store, and memory | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Abstract base classes |
| 2.3.5 | Validate extracted components maintain RAG functionality | Not Started | 2025-08-27 | Test core RAG operations |

## Progress Log
### 2025-08-27
- Task created based on Phase 2.3 of the API restructure implementation plan
- Set up subtasks for retriever, vector store, and memory extraction
- Ready for implementation to begin

## Dependencies
- TASK002: Directory structure must be created
- TASK003: Core infrastructure should be in place

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Retrieval logic extracted and functional in new location
- [ ] Vector store operations separated and working
- [ ] Conversation memory extracted and preserved
- [ ] Base interfaces created for all components
- [ ] All RAG functionality preserved
- [ ] Components can be used independently
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved

## Risks
- **High Risk**: Core RAG functionality could be broken during extraction
- **Mitigation**: Incremental extraction with comprehensive testing
- **Potential Issue**: Complex interdependencies within rag.py
- **Mitigation**: Careful dependency mapping before extraction begins
